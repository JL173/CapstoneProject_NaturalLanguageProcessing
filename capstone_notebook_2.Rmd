# Alternate methods to explore

## Currently using Katz-smoothing

using alpha multiplying the rest (n-1)-grams for the rest of the probability distribution

## Good-Turing smoothing

n-gram occurs r times, it now occurs
(r + 1) * n + 1 / n   times

example, a 3-gram of freq = 20
now → 21 * 4/3 = 28 times

## Knesser-Nay smoothing
