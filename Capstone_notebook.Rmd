What we've learned is that the predictive model is Highly dependent on the training data. And so, it must be representative of the whole dataset to predict accurately. The bottleneck of this model is the reading in/loading of the text files. Especially with the SampleLoadFiles function. 



```{r, time_it = TRUE}
# this has 4-gram, can predict off three words
model <- CallAll("data/en_US/10/",
                 coverage = 0.90,
                 filter = stop_words)
```

```{r}
for (string in test_strings){
  print(MatchStringPredict(string,
                           model,
                           stem = TRUE,
                           filter = stop_words))
}
```
